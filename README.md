# SuperMario Generator: <a href="https://super-arithmetic-4e5fcb.netlify.app" target="_blank">Visit Here</a>
A web app showing information about your favorite supermario characters.
#### Tech Used:

- This webapp was created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.



## Optimizations
- **Next up:** I want to add a filter to show all characters of a particular species (ex.koopa)
- I plan to add pictures to each character and possibly use a cloud service as data storage.


## Lessons Learned:
- I got the chance to play around with the backend a bit more and I'm excited to dive deeper into Node.js and Express. It was fun building the API on the backend and using it in this web app to fetch data. It made me appreciate more the huge sets of data in API and how someone meticulously put it together.
